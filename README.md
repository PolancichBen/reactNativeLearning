# React Native Tutorial
This Repo is a simple visualization of React Native's components through a series of subset components rendered on a single homepage with a series of buttons to navigate to each individual component. For those learning the basics of React Native, such as myself, going through the React Native docs and understanding what each component can do is invaluable. I highly recommend anyone interested in React Native to feel free to fork and clone this code, go to the React Native docs, and feel free to play around with this repo. Take a moment and look at the additional methods each component has to offer as well.

I also want to add a short line here that the new "Pressable" component listed on the React Native docs does not seem to be functional as of yet. I have the code commented out but feel free to look at it and if you find the fix please let me know or make a pull request so I can update it. Thanks.

### What you'll need to get started:
